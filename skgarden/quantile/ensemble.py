    A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying
    decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging

           Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default="auto")

          split.

        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_depth : integer or None, optional (default=None)

          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.

        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;

        Controls the verbosity of the tree building process.

    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit

        y_weights_[i, j] is the weight given to sample ``j` while
        estimator ``i`` is fit. If bootstrap is set to True, this
        reduces to a 2-D array of ones.

    y_train_leaves_ : array-like, shape=(n_estimators, n_samples)
        y_train_leaves_[i, j] provides the leaf node that y_train_[i]
