        ----------

        sample_weight : array-like, shape = [n_samples] or None
            Sample weights. If None, then samples are equally weighted. Splits
            that would create child nodes with net zero or negative weight are
            ignored while searching for a split in each node. Splits are also

        X_idx_sorted : array-like, shape = [n_samples, n_features], optional

class DecisionTreeQuantileRegressor(DecisionTreeRegressor, BaseTreeQuantileRegressor):
    """A decision tree regressor that provides quantile estimates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    criterion : string, optional (default="mse")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "mse" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance
        reduction as feature selection criterion, and "mae" for the mean
        absolute error.
        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.

    splitter : string, optional (default="best")
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a percentage and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_depth : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int, float, optional (default=2)
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for percentages.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional (default=1)
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for percentages.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, optional (default=0.)
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.


    Attributes
    ----------
    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]
        The feature importances.
        The higher, the more important the feature.
        The importance of a feature is computed as the
        (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought
        by that feature. It is also known as the Gini importance [4]_.

    max_features_ : int,
        The inferred value of max_features.

    n_features_ : int
        The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.

    tree_ : Tree object
        The underlying Tree object.

    y_train_ : array-like
        Train target values.

    y_train_leaves_ : array-like.
        Cache the leaf nodes that each training sample falls into.
        y_train_leaves_[i] is the leaf that y_train[i] ends up at.
